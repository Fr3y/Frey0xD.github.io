    <h1>Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Gather up all of the crew!<br>
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!<br>
Sea wind blows. To where?<br>
Who knows?<br>
The waves will be our guide!<br>
O'er across the ocean's tide,<br>
Rays of sunshine far and wide,<br>
Birds they sing of cheerful things, in circles passing by!<br>
<br>
  <br>
  
Bid farewell to weaver's town!<br>
Say so long to port renowned!<br>
Sing a song, it won't be long, before we're casting off!<br>
Cross the gold and silver seas<br>
The salty spray puts us at ease!<br>
Day and night to our delight,<br>
The voyage never ends!<br>
Gather up all of the crew!<br>
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!<br>
Pirates we, eternally are challenging the sea!<br>
With the waves to rest our heads,<br>
ship beneath us as our beds!<br>
Hoisted high upon the mast our Jolly Roger flies!<br>
Somewhere in the endless sky,<br>
Stormy winds are blowin' by!<br>
Waves are dancing, evening comes,<br>
It's time to sound the drums!<br>
But steady men may never fear!<br>
Tomorrow's skies are always clear!<br>
So pound your feet and clap your hands till sunny days return!<br>
<br>
  <br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Gather up all of the crew!<br><br>
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!<br>
Wave good-bye, but don't you cry<br><br>
Our memories remain.<br>
Our days are but a passing dream, everlasting though they seem<br>
'neath the moon we'll meet again, the wind's our lullaby!<br>
Gather up all of the crew!<br>
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!<br>
Sing a song and play along<br>
For all the ocean's wide!<br>
After all is said and done,<br>
you'll end up a skeleton!<br>
So spread your tale, from dawn till dusk, upon these boney seas!<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,<br>
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho.<br>
